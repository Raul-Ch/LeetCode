<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
To determine the confirmation rate for each user, we need to analyze the actions recorded in our database. Our goal is to identify how many actions are classified as "confirmed" relative to the total actions each user has taken. Our initial approach? Count the number of confirmed actions for each user and then calculate the average confirmation rate across users.

# Approach
To determine the confirmation rate for each user, we need to analyze the actions logged in the database. Our objective is to count how many actions are classified as "confirmed" and how many are "timeout" for each user. Once we have that, we can calculate the average confirmation rate. The approach is simple: for every user, count the number of confirmed actions and calculate the rate relative to the total actions taken.

First, we execute a query to observe how many times each user has actions classified as "confirmed" or "timeout." Additionally, we’ve added an extra row for a user with user_id = 2 for demonstration purposes. This helps us see the table in a test scenario where user 2 has actions in both categories. Here’s the query used:

```
SELECT
    S.user_id,
    SUM(CASE WHEN C.action = 'confirmed' THEN 1.0 ELSE 0.0 END) AS confirmation_sum,
    SUM(CASE WHEN C.action = 'timeout' THEN 1.0 ELSE 0.0 END) AS timeout_sum
FROM
    Signups AS S
LEFT JOIN
    Confirmations as C
ON
    S.user_id = C.user_id
GROUP BY
    S.user_id, c.ACTION;
```
The query returns a table where each row represents a user, with columns showing the total number of confirmed actions (confirmation_sum) and timeout actions (timeout_sum). The result for user_id = 2 demonstrates the correct handling of actions:

WE GET:

As you can see, the table aggregates the actions per user, giving us an understanding of how often each user confirms or times out.

Know we know we need somehting like this to calculate the confirmation rate:
` ROUND(AVG(COUNT(C.action = "confirmed")),2) as confirmation_rate`
# ****But this syntax is not feasible in SQL because COUNT cannot be nested directly within AVG in this manner.****
Instead, we need to calculate the sum of confirmed actions per user with a SUM statement like this:
```
SUM(CASE WHEN c.action = 'confirmed' THEN 1.00 ELSE 0.00 END) AS confirmation_sum
```
This approach tallies the number of confirmed actions per user, which we will use to calculate the confirmation rate. The reason we use SUM here is that it allows us to count the number of confirmed actions by evaluating each row individually and adding 1 to the total for every "confirmed" action.

# SOLUTION Code
Now, we calculate the confirmation rate for each user with the following query:
```mssql []
SELECT
    S.user_id,
    ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN C.action = 'confirmed' THEN 1.0 ELSE 0.0 END), 2) AS confirmation_rate
FROM
    Signups AS S
LEFT JOIN
    Confirmations as C
ON
    S.user_id = C.user_id
GROUP BY
    S.user_id;
```

# Step-by-step breakdown:
1. **Query the Tables:** We join the Signups table with the Confirmations table using a LEFT JOIN to include all users, even if they don’t have any confirmation actions.
2. **Count Confirmed Actions:** We use a CASE statement within SUM to count how many times each user has an action categorized as "confirmed."
3. **Group by User:** The GROUP BY clause ensures that the results are grouped by user_id, allowing us to calculate the confirmation rate per user.
4. **Calculate the Average Confirmation Rate:** Finally, we use ROUND(AVG(...), 2) to compute the confirmation rate for each user, rounded to two decimal places.

# QUESTIONS?

How Does AVG() Calculate the Confirmation Rate? The AVG() function calculates the average by considering the ratio of confirmed actions to total actions per user. For example, if user_id = 2 has 3 confirmed actions out of 6 total actions, the confirmation rate would be 0.5 (50%).

**In this case:**
The query calculates how many actions are classified as "confirmed."
The AVG() function computes the ratio of confirmed actions per user, presenting an average confirmation rate.

**DEEPER UNDERSTANDING**

- JOIN: The LEFT JOIN operation connects the Signups and Confirmations tables, ensuring we capture all actions for each user. It includes users who may not have any confirmed actions and helps us accurately calculate their engagement.

- GROUP BY user_id: Grouping by user_id aggregates the actions per user, meaning each user_id will have its own calculated confirmation rate, based on how many actions are classified as confirmed or timed out.

- AVG() and Confirmation Rate: The AVG() function calculates the average confirmation rate for each user by dividing the confirmed actions by the total actions within each group of user_id.
